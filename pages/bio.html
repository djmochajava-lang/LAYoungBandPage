            You know that saying "steel sharpens steel"? Well honey, I lived
            it—literally. At 18 years old, I became the first female crane
            operator in Ohio's steel mills, breaking barriers before I ever
            stepped on a stage.
          </p>

          <p>
            Growing up in 1980s Ohio was like living in the epicenter of a
            musical earthquake. The Staple Singers, Blues legends, R&B queens,
            Funk masters—that sound was in the air we breathed. I soaked it all
            up like a sponge, letting it become part of my DNA. My mama used to
            say I was born with rhythm in my bones and fire in my belly, and she
            wasn't wrong.
          </p>

          <p>
            People tell me my voice sounds like
            <strong>Chaka Khan meets Phyllis Hyman</strong>—and honestly? That's
            the best compliment I could ever receive. Those women taught me that
            power doesn't mean you sacrifice emotion, and emotion doesn't mean
            you sacrifice technique. You give it all, every single note, every
            single time.
          </p>

          <p>
            From singing at
            <strong>President Clinton's second inauguration</strong> (pinch me,
            right?) to opening for
            <strong>Frederick Anthony Jackson</strong> and recording with jazz
            legends <strong>Pieces of A Dream</strong>, I've been blessed to
            share stages with incredible artists. But here's what I've learned:
            it doesn't matter if you're in the White House or a local jazz
            club—when that music hits and you connect with the audience, that's
            where the magic happens.
          </p>

          <p>
            These days, I'm working with the legendary
            <strong>Norman Connors</strong>, crafting a sound that honors where
            we came from while pushing soul music somewhere new. My single
            <strong>"No One Can Love You More"</strong> hit #1 on UK FM radio,
            and we've got multiple top 5 hits following. But you know what? The
            numbers are cool, but what really matters is when someone comes up
            after a show with tears in their eyes, telling me the music touched
            their soul. That's why I do this.

          Let me tell you about Ms. Phyllis. When I first heard her voice as a
          young girl, something shifted in me. It wasn't just her incredible
          range or her technical mastery—it was the way she could make you feel
          every word, every emotion, like she was sitting right next to you,
          telling you her story.
        </p>

        <p class="highlight-text">
          My Phyllis Hyman tribute isn't just a performance—it's a spiritual
          connection, a love letter to a woman who changed my life.
        </p>

        <p>
          I spent years studying her voice, her phrasing, the way she could
          break your heart with a single note and then lift you back up with the
          next. When I bring "Ms. Phyllis" back to life on stage, I do it with
          authenticity, reverence, and a whole lot of soul. People tell me they
          close their eyes and she's right there in the room with us. That's the
          highest honor I could ever receive.
